# Korean-Bakery-Sales

### Project Background
In the bustling world of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), the heartwarming aroma of freshly baked goods often emanates from quaint local bakeries. These small enterprises contribute significantly to the local economy and community. However, many of these businesses face challenges in managing and growing their operations due to limited resources and technology.

This project is designed to empower local bakery owners with simple and effective tools to streamline their operations, make informed decisions, and foster business growth. Recognizing the constraints of MSMEs, our focus is on leveraging accessible and widely used tools, such as Microsoft Excel, to provide practical solutions.

### Objectives
1. Track and analyze the bakery's income through a detailed income line chart to monitor financial performance and identify trends over time
2. Utilize the rush hour bar chart to understand peak hours of customer activity, enabling effective preparation and resource allocation during high-demand periods
3. Gain insights into customer preferences by referencing the favorited menu bar chart, allowing for informed decisions on menu offerings and promotional strategies to enhance overall sales
